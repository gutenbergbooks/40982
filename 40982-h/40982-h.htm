    <h2>
      MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two accounts of the miraculous conception, one in the gospel
      according to St. Matthew, the other in the gospel according to St. Luke.
      In both these accounts there are several collateral circumstances which
      are here printed from the approved version, but the examination is
      intended to be confined as closely as possible to those parts only which
      relate to the miraculous conception, and, consequently, to the supposed
      divinity of Jesus Christ. That the Christian reader may see nakedly, and
      without disguise, the grounds of his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story in St. Matthew is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHAP. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: <i>when as his mother
      Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
      child of the Holy Ghost.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "19. <i>Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to make
      her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "20. <i>But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord
      appeared unto him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
      to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
      the Holy Ghost.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "21. 'And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus:
      for he shall save his people from their sins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "99. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of
      the Lord by the prophet, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "93. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
      and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted, is God
      with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "94. <i>Then Joseph being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord
      had bidden him, and took unto him his wife.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "25. And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son. And
      he called his name Jesus."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all St. Matthew says on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Luke's account is more circumstantial, it is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHAP. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest
      named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters
      of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
      commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "7. And they had no child, because that Elizabeth was barren, and they
      both were now well stricken in years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "8. And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before
      God in the order of his course,
    </p>
    <p>
      "9. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn
      incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
      time of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "11. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
      right side of the altar of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "19. And when Zacharias saw him he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "13. But the angel said unto him, 'Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is
      heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call
      his name John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "14. 'And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his
      birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "15. 'For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
      neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost,
      even from his mother's womb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "16. 'And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "17. 'And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn
      the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
      wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "18. And Zacharias said unto the angel, 'Whereby shall I know this? for I
      am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "19. And the angel answering said unto him, 'I am Gabriel, that stand in
      the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee
      these glad tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "90. 'And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
      day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my
      words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "21. And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so
      long in the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "22. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them; and they
      perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto
      them, and remained speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "23. And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration
      were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "24. And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself
      five months, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "25. 'Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on
      me, to take away my reproach among men.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "26. <i>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
      city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "27. <i>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house
      of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "28. <i>And the angel came in unto her, and said, 'Hail, thou that art
      highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "29. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her
      mind what manner of salutation this should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "30. And the angel said unto her, 'Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
      favour with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "31. 'And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son,
      and shalt call his name Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "39.'He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and
      the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
    </p>
    <p>
      "33. 'And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
      kingdom there shall be no end.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "34. Then said Mary unto the angel, 'How shall this be, seeing I know not
      a man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "35. And the angel answered and said unto her, 'The Holy Ghost shall come
      upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
      also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "36. 'And, behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in
      her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
    </p>
    <p>
      "37. 'For with God nothing shall be impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "38. And Mary said, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
      according to thy word.' And the angel departed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "39. And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill-country with
      haste, into a city of Juda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "40. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "41. And it came to pass, that, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of
      Mary, the babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
      Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "42. And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, 'Blessed art thou
      among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "43. 'And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to
      me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "44. 'For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine
      ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "45. 'And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance
      of those things which were told her from the Lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "46. <i>And Mary said, 'My soul doth magnify the Lord.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "47. '<i>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "48. '<i>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
      behold, from henceforth all generations shall-call me blessed.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "49. '<i>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy, it
      his name.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "50. '<i>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
      generation.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "51. "<i>He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud
      in the imagination of their hearts.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "52. '<i>He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of
      low degree.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "53. '<i>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath
      sent empty away.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "54. '<i>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "55. '<i>As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
      ever.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "56. '<i>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
      own house.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the foregoing matter, as well that taken from Matthew as that
      from Luke, is rejected by the Unitarians as spurious. This sect, which is
      every day increasing, contains, and has long contained, many very learned
      men; and these men have for the use of the sect made a new translation of
      the Testament, which is published under the title of "The New Testament,
      in an improved Version," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a long note, appended to the 16th verse of the 1st chapter of St.
      Matthew, reasons are given for rejecting the story of the miraculous
      conception. Among other things it observes, "The account of the miraculous
      conception of Jesus was probably the fiction of some early Gentile
      convert, who hoped, by elevating the founder, to abate the popular
      prejudices against the sect. See upon this subject, Dr. Priestley's
      History of Early Opinions, Vol. IV. Book iii. c. 99; Pope on the
      Miraculous Conception; Dr. Williams's Free Enquiry; Dr. Bell's Arguments
      for the Authenticity of the Narratives of Matthew and Luke, and Dr.
      Williams's Remarks; Dr. Campbell's and Dr. Newcombe's Notes upon the Text;
      Mr. Evanson's Dissonance, chap. i. sect. 3. chap. iii. sect. S.; Jones's
      Developement of Events, Vol. I. p. 365," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a note to the 1st chapter of Luke, the Improved Version has six
      articles, containing reasons for rejecting both that and the succeeding
      chapter. The six articles are summed up by the following observation: "And
      there are many other circumstances in the story which wear an improbable
      and fabulous aspect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has," they continue, "been objected, that so large and gross an
      interpolation could not have escaped detection, and would never have been
      so early and so generally received. In reply to this objection it is
      observed, that the interpolation was not admitted into the Hebrew 1 copies
      of Matthew's Gospel, nor into Marcion's 2 copies of Luke.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 The language in which Matthew is supposed to have written.

     2 Marcion was the leader of a sect in the second century.
</pre>
    <p>
      That it is notorious that forged writings, under the names of the
      apostles, were in circulation almost from the apostolic age. See 2
      Thessalonians, chap. ii. ver. 2. That the orthodox charge the heretics
      with corrupting the text; and that the heretics recriminate upon the
      orthodox. Also, that it was much easier to introduce interpolation when
      copies were few and scarce, than since they have been multiplied by means
      of the press. And, finally, that the interpolation in question would, to
      the generality of Christians, be extremely gratifying, as it would lessen
      the odium attached to Christianity from its founder being a crucified Jew,
      and would elevate him to the dignity of the heroes and demi-gods of the
      heathen mythology."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unitarians, reject all that is related of the birth of Christ, as
      spurious and interpolated, and of course consider him as the son of Joseph
      and Mary, begotten in the ordinary way; and they give references to many
      scholars and inquisitive men, in whose works the curious reader will find
      a number of learned arguments against the stories of Matthew and Luke
      being received, and to these he is referred. What follows is a short
      examination of the two stories on the principles of what is usually called
      common sense, in the way in which an ordinary man would investigate a tale
      in which he was interested in knowing the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will begin with Matthew, because he is admitted to have been the oldest
      writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ver. 18. "Before they came together." It was necessary to premise this,
      because their "coming together" was in no way disreputable according to
      the custom of the Jews of that time. It was usual, when both the parties
      were of mature age, for them to come together as soon as they were
      espoused; if the woman became great with child, they were then married, if
      otherwise, the espousement continued for a year, when the parties were
      usually married; but it sometimes happened that they separated by consent.
      Not having children being considered a curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ver. 19. "Joseph was minded to put her away <i>privily</i>." In the former
      verse it is said, "she was found with child of the Holy Ghost", here, it
      seems, it was not suspected to be "of the Holy Ghost," but by a man, and
      that too as a fraud upon Joseph, who was minded in consequence to put her
      away. It follows, also, that Mary was unconscious that it was "of the Holy
      Ghost" she was breeding, or we must suppose she would not have failed to
      have told Joseph of so very important a circumstance; it is, however,
      abundantly plain, she told him nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was found with child." How found? her own confession. No such thing;
      had that been the case, it would certainly have been mentioned; and the
      angel which, in the next verse, came on purpose to announce it, would,
      instead of announcing it, have come only to have confirmed her account of
      her being with child, without having known man, and to say how it
      happened. But, no; the angel comes not for any such purpose, but to
      prevent her being put away when it had been discovered that she was
      breeding. By what was she found to be with child. By her appearance? No;
      in that case, "putting her away privily" would have been absurd? By her
      friends? No; "putting her away privily" would in that case have been
      equally absurd. It could then have been known to no one but her husband
      Joseph, who finding himself imposed upon, was willing to hide his shame by
      getting rid of her in the quietest way he could. But all this happened
      "before they came together;" this assertion was made for the open-mouthed,
      wide-throated, credulous, ignorant people, to whom this Gospel was
      addressed, and for their successors, "who strain at a gnat, and swallow a
      camel."
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had "not come together," all Joseph would have had to do would
      have been to send her home again to her parents; he would have had no
      occasion to cogitate oh the means of getting rid of her; he would have
      told her relations, "My bargain was for sound ware, and I cannot take this
      'cracked pitcher,'" and there the matter would have ended. But it was by
      their coming together that Joseph found out she was with child; how long
      they had cohabited does not appear, but it must have been some time,
      according to the easy, familiar style of the narrative: "When as his
      mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together she was
      found with child." Their having been together, and her being with child,
      were indeed the only reasons why he could not send her home again, as
      barrenness was a curse, so fruitfulness was a blessing, and had Joseph
      sent her home he would have been reminded that he had possessed the person
      of his espoused, and was in a fair way to be blessed. According to the
      Jewish law and custom, he had no cause for complaint, and could have
      received no redress; therefore he "thought on these things, and was minded
      to put her away privily."
    </p>
    <p>
      So far this story is told in a bungling manner, pompously introduced by a
      falsehood, that "she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ver. 20. "But while he thought of these things, behold, the angel of the
      Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, thou son of David,
      fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in
      her is of the Holy Ghost.'" In verse 18, "she was found to be with child
      of the Holy Ghost," and then, and not till then, Joseph was going to put
      her away; plain enough it is, if the words have any meaning, that "she was
      found with child," but not "of the Holy Ghost" if it had been so, it could
      not have been said, "Then Joseph was minded to put her away," neither
      would it have been necessary for "the angel of the Lord" to pester him in
      his sleep, as he is said to have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cavillers may talk themselves blind, learned doctors may preach themselves
      hoarse, commentators may write "so many books, that the world would not
      contain them," they will never be able to make any thing more of this
      story than that a poor, ignorant, credulous man, dreamed in his sleep that
      an angel had been talking nonsense to him; this folly might have passed,
      as no doubt it did pass for reason, some centuries ago, when almost every
      body had faith in dreams, but it is an ill compliment to the intelligence
      of the present generation to expect it should be equally besotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph dreamed that he saw an angel, that the angel told him his wife was
      with child by God himself, (the Holy Ghost being God), and ver. 24, "Then
      Joseph being raised from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had
      commanded him, and took unto him his wife." But did Joseph dream? Perhaps
      he did; but whether he did or did not, clear enough it is that he, and he
      alone, could relate that he had dreamed; whether or not he did make such a
      relation we are not told, but we are left to infer that he did, because
      somebody, nobody knows who, has written that he did say he had dreamed.
      But if he had dreamed, and had personally related his dream to every one
      of us, would that be any reason for our believing that God had got his
      wife with child, and that an angel had been sent to tell him so? Talk of
      blasphemy; in what can this relation be paralleled as blasphemous, except
      indeed by the grossest credulity? A poor, ignorant man relates a dream,
      and all the world are called upon not only to believe his relation of that
      dream, absurd, abominable, and ridiculous as it is, but to place their
      everlasting happiness upon the absurd relation, to inculcate a belief for
      it into their children, to waste their substance in paying people to
      preach it, and to persecute to death those whose minds cannot receive the
      monstrous doctrine as undoubted truth. Moral evidence there is none, there
      can be none;&mdash;there is nothing in the story which can be compared and
      contrasted; there is nothing out of it which can elucidate it; it is
      nothing more than a pretended relation of a credulous man&mdash;<i>That
      he, being a sleep, had dreamed a dream.</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the account given by St. Luke, not one word of all this story
      is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Luke. Chap. I.&mdash;Here the story is altogether, from the beginning
      to the end, a different one from that told by Matthew. Here there is no
      account,

      1. Of Mary being found with child.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Of Joseph's intention to put her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Of Joseph's dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Of the angel appearing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Of his changing his mind, and resolving to keep her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be observed, that these five items include the whole account in
      Matthew. So, in Luke, not one of the circumstances related are told by
      Matthew. In Matthew, Joseph is made the important personage, while poor
      Mary seems to have been ignorant of all that was passing; in Luke she is
      made the important personage, and poor Joseph is now as ignorant as Mary
      was according to the former relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke's account is indeed very circumstantial, he says it was the angel
      Gabriel who visited Mary, but although he relates the very words which
      passed between them, it does not appear that Mary knew she was conversing
      with an angel; he did not announce himself as an angel, nor is there one
      word in the dialogue between them which can fairly be said to indicate any
      such understanding on the part of Mary: she does not appear to have been
      at all surprised at the visit, private and abrupt as it was. "<i>She was
      troubled at his saying</i>," not at his presence, "<i>and cast in her mind
      what manner of salutation this should be;</i>" at this salutation she
      might, to be sure, be somewhat confounded, although she immediately
      afterwards submitted herself so humbly to her guest. "<i>All these things
      she kept in her heart,</i>" for it does not appear that she communicated
      any of them to her husband; to him she never opened her lips on the
      subject; no angel visited him, sleeping or waking, to tell him of it;
      nothing is said about his "<i>knowing her not till she had brought forth
      her first-born</i>" they lived together in the ordinary way of poor
      people, as man and wife, until she was brought to bed in a stable, Joseph
      all the time considering the child as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke's story, stripped of its verbiage, is this:&mdash;The angel Gabriel
      was sent by God to Mary, who was espoused to Joseph. The angel addresses
      her very familiarly&mdash;she becomes alarmed, and the angel tells her she
      shall "conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his
      name Jesus." Mary, in her simplicity, asks how that can be, "seeing I know
      not a man." The angel replies,&mdash;"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
      and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee." And Mary says,
      "Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word."
      Mary then went to her cousin Elizabeth, who lived at a distance "in the
      hill-country, where she staid about three months," and then she came home
      again. Afterwards Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem to be taxed, (enrolled);
      here Mary is delivered in a stable, there being no room in the inn.

      A Mr. Le Clerc, a very learned, that is, a very bookish man, made what he
      called a harmony of the Evangelists; he puts the relation of Luke first,
      and supposes all that he relates, happened to Mary, before Joseph and she
      got together: and that she concealed from him all that had passed between
      her and the angel Gabriel, and between her and Elizabeth; and that Joseph
      being left in utter ignorance of all that had passed, resolved to put her
      away. To prevent this, says the learned Doctor, an angel appeared to him
      in a dream (what does appearing in a dream mean, simply in his
      imagination) and told him the story as related by Matthew. The learned
      Doctor says: "Joseph being awaked from his dream, perceived it had been
      sent by God, as well because Mary, upon his enquiry, related to him what
      had happened to her just after the same manner as the angel had told him
      in his sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      To what miserable shifts is folly driven to support superstition; what
      miserable pretexts does roguery have recourse to, to propagate and uphold
      imposition! Not one word is there to warrant this pretended conference
      with Mary, which the learned Doctor has so circumstantially related. That
      Joseph was ignorant of the intercourse Mary had had with the angel, could
      not be concealed from the reader, who believed Matthew's relation,
      according to which Mary had said nothing to Joseph of the communication
      and commerce she had had with the angel, neither is there the least reason
      from that account to suppose that Matthew knew any thing of the decently
      told story of Elizabeth, or of Mary's going and remaining three months
      with her; but, according to Luke, she hurried off in her exultation of
      being with child, and there they communed together in a state of the
      highest enthusiasm. Elizabeth, being filled with the Holy Ghost, and the
      babe leaping for joy in her womb, spake out in a loud voice,&mdash;and
      Mary followed in the same manner, and in the same strain. But
      notwithstanding this, notwithstanding the exultation between the women,
      Joseph was not to be let into the secret; all the rapturous feelings of
      Mary were now subdued; she not only suppressed her joy which seemed
      unbounded, but she kept the whole matter a profound secret, even at a risk
      of being turned out of doors as a strumpet, and an angel is obliged to be
      sent from God to Joseph in a dream, to prevent the catastrophe; the
      deception is approved by God, who sends the "angel from heaven" to
      reconcile Joseph to his wife's perfidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Matthew, a certain man had a dream. According to Luke, an
      angel called privately on a young woman, who, in consequence of the visit,
      was with child. And this is all there is to establish the divinity of
      Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be called evidence, for by whom it was given, whether by the man
      himself, or the woman herself, nobody knows; to whom it was given, if it
      was given, nobody knows; when it was given, nobody knows; where it was
      given, nobody knows; and the learned are even disputing to this very time
      about the language in which the stories were originally written, and by
      whom they were written. And yet not literally to believe either or both of
      these worse than "old wives' tales," is to subject a man to persecution;
      not to affect to believe that which, when stripped of the absurd reverence
      which has been cast round it, no man ever did or ever can believe, is to
      be imputed to him as a reproach of so horrible a nature, that, thousands,
      who treat it as it deserves in their own minds, dare not avow their
      disbelief; not to commit the immoral act of self-delusion and debasement
      is imputed as a crime, and men are shunned because they are moral.

      The sanctity thrown around this sad nonsense; the cry of blasphemy which
      has been raised against any one who ventured to examine it, the horror
      felt by fanatics, which vented itself in persecutions the most
      diversified, deterred people from trusting to reason, and made them even
      forget that it was by reason alone they are ever able to choose one
      religion in preference to another. Every religious sect allows, that you
      may use your reason to distinguish between what they hold out to you, and
      what you yourself believe; you may, and you ought, they tell you, to
      exercise your reason so far as to give their doctrines the preference; and
      having thus exercised your reason, and having by its aid abandoned your
      former notions, and adopted theirs; having become "a child of grace," and
      turned to the right way, there shall be "more joy in heaven at your
      conversion than over ninety and nine just persons, who" having always
      belonged to the sect, "needed no conversion." All sects proclaim this joy,
      at the same moment, as each makes converts from the others; with all of
      them reason to choose your faith is the great the good, but having
      exercised it so far, there you must stop, reason must be instantly
      extinguished; on no account must you trust to such a "blind guide;"
      reason, which but just before was all but omnipotent, is now "fallible"&mdash;"<i>poor
      fallible reason</i>," all is now <i>"faith"</i> examine any one of their
      dogmas, you are a "backslider;" doubt any one of their absurd relations,
      you are a "blasphemer;" and thus it is that ignorance and persecution
      brutalizes and degrades mankind. Had the stories of Joseph and Mary been
      preached to us from the sacred books of the Persians, how would every good
      Christian have been scandalized! "What," he would have exclaimed, "what
      horrid blasphemy! first to pretend that God himself (the Holy Ghost being
      God) had commerce with a woman, by which she became with child, and who
      all the time she was breeding lived with a man, lived with him, too, by
      command of 'an angel sent from God,' lived with him as his wife in such a
      way that no one seems to have suspected the child was not his own, and
      after the birth of God, (God the Son being God) in the ordinary way of all
      mankind, and still living with him, and having other children by him. 1
      First God has her, then Joseph has her; These are abominable stories,
      indeed. Call out blasphemy at yourselves, ye fanatical persecutors of
      other men's opinions. Shame, pity, contempt, are the passions those
      terrible tales excite for you, compassion for those who are so unfortunate
      as to become your victims."
